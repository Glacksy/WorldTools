TODO LIST:

- classic water  (done i think)
- disable health regain
- Prevent dirt from turning in to grass (spreading)
- Prevent mushrooms from spreading  (one for red and one for brown)
- Prevent mobs from destroying crops (only mobs)
- Prevent water from destroying redwire
- Prevent water from destroying torches (one for normal and one for red ;))


also we should add:

prevent-lightning-strike-blocks=
prevent-waterspread-blocks=      (blocks water shouldnt "flow" to/on)
prevent-lavaspread-blocks=       (blocks lava shouldnt "flow" or spread to/on)
prevent-firespread-blocks=       
disable-xp-orb-drops=            (possible in server.prop but still changeable by  ect.getServer i think)

anti-wolf-dumbness=
the last one will give wolf some sort of godmode, so they cant die by lava,fire,cactus and explosion, nothing else!
also the wolf HAVE to be tamed or this wont work.

- add  /locate <player> , this will return world, dimension, coords
- add /stoplag  ,  this will kill all mobs, kill all items in all dimensions and worlds. will also disable redstone changes so "lagg machines wont work"
